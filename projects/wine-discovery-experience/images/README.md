### For wine_discovery15.jpg (Hero Image):
```
A sophisticated digital interface for a wine discovery platform with a dark elegant background. The interface should feature a personalized taste profile visualization using a radial chart with flavor categories like "Fruity," "Tannic," "Bold," and "Acidic" in deep wine reds (#8C1C13), gold (#B68D40), and cream (#F1F0EA) accents. Include high-quality bottle images arranged in a curated collection with tasteful typography and wine region maps. The UI should have glassmorphism elements, subtle reflections, and wine-inspired design cues. Show personalized recommendation cards with user preference matching indicators and expert tasting notes. Design should be premium, sophisticated, and accessible with a balance of visual wine imagery and clean data visualization elements.
```

### For wine_discovery13.jpg (User Journey Flow):
```
A detailed customer journey map/flow diagram for a wine discovery experience using an elegant color scheme of burgundy (#8C1C13), gold (#B68D40), cream (#F1F0EA), and charcoal (#333333). The visualization should show a horizontal flow with 5 connected stages: 1) Preference Assessment (showing interactive taste questionnaire), 2) Flavor Profiling (displaying a personal taste fingerprint visualization), 3) Curated Recommendations (showing bottle matches with percentage indicators), 4) Learning Journey (showing educational content), and 5) Purchase & Sharing (showing mobile and in-store touchpoints). Include small user personas following different paths and decision points. Add data visualization elements showing preference mapping, and include tasteful wine imagery. The design should be premium with subtle textures reminiscent of wine labels, cork, and vineyard elements, presented as a professional UX/product strategy deliverable.
```

### For wine_discovery10.jpg (Mobile Application):
```
A premium mobile app interface for a wine discovery platform displayed on an elegant smartphone mockup against a subtle vineyard background. The app screen shows a personalized user dashboard with a prominent taste profile visualization using a spider/radar chart in rich wine colors (#8C1C13, #B68D40, #F1F0EA). Below the profile, show a horizontal scrolling row of recommended wine bottles with matching percentage indicators and small flavor icons. Include a "My Journey" section showing progression through different wine regions or taste categories. The design should incorporate subtle wine-inspired textures, sophisticated typography, and an intuitive navigation system with icons for "Discover," "My Profile," "Learn," and "Cellar." The overall aesthetic should be luxurious yet approachable, aimed at both novice and experienced wine enthusiasts with a focus on personalization and guided discovery.
