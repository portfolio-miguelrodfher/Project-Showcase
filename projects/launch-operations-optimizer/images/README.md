# Launch Operations Optimizer - Image Requirements

This directory contains placeholder SVG images for the Launch Operations Optimizer case study. 
These should be replaced with high-quality images that represent the project more accurately.

## Required Images

1. **launch-operations-hero.svg**
   - Hero image showing the dashboard interface
   - Should visualize timeline, dependencies, and resource allocation
   - Recommended dimensions: 1200px x 675px (16:9 aspect ratio)

2. **launch-operations-process.svg**
   - Process flow visualization showing optimization points
   - Should highlight efficiency gains at key transition points
   - Recommended dimensions: 1200px x 675px (16:9 aspect ratio)

3. **launch-operations-dashboard.svg**
   - Dashboard visualization with real-time metrics
   - Should show resource allocation and progress tracking
   - Recommended dimensions: 1200px x 675px (16:9 aspect ratio)

## Visual Style Guidelines

- Use a blue-based color scheme with orange accents for emphasis
- Maintain a clean, data-focused aesthetic
- Use visual elements that communicate efficiency and optimization
- Include data visualizations where appropriate (charts, graphs, metrics)

Replace these placeholder SVGs with actual screenshots, mockups, or professionally designed visualizations that match the project's visual identity.
